# Using Beautiful Soup to scrape information from car sale ads

The first program (Scrape_car_links.py) creates an SQL database, crawls through a leading European used car sales website and stores links to each individual ad in the database.

The second program (Scrape_car_ads.py) accesses each of the links and scrapes html data including car make, model, year of registration, mileage etc. The data is then written into the SQL database.
